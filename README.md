 75 Hard challenge in GO

This project is a solution that will help users track their progress in the 75 Hard challenge. Firstly the user will be able to add all the tasks that must be completed each day. These will remain the same during the full course of the challenge. 

Each day the program will prompt the user asking whether they have compled the specified tasks. If all have been completed successfully the challenge will progress to the next day and if not, the counter will reset to day 1. 

Additionally, the application will help the user by giving a motivational quote after each succsessful day.
